# JavaLoginSystem
This is a complete (Yet not really that secured), java login system made completely in eclipse using mySQL and Java

How does it work?

Well its fairly simple in perspective but for a first timer with almost little knowledge and little sources really out there it took a bit
hell around 3-4 days to finish taking 4-5 hours a day of either research or trying out different things

It works like this:
You click on the Run application button, usually on your IDE and you will be presented with a login window, in this login window I set up
3 "Bank account ID numbers" from the SQL server and when you type one of these numbers in, the window will open and you will be presented 
information on this persons account, ofcourse all this info is faked and just test variables I set up, info includes Persons name, there address, current balance, an image of the person (I just set an empty one but you can modify your own), there email address which is also fake. This entire concept of the project, was to create an application that would allow people access there bank account info using a simple mySQL database based off of the inital credentials they provide which would be the bank identification number which means, if the ID is different, then the page will be different. It was actually quite a grueling experience trying to get all this to work, will be uploading files later on tho. Enjoy.

You need to make your own database tho following the format, I made it so it would connect to a mysql database from workbench.
